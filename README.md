Setting up a local instance of Whole Tale
=========================================

This directory contains scripts required to run a full instance of the Whole Tale platform  on a single system (e.g., laptop or VM). The installation uses a predefined domain `*.vcap.me` which maps to localhost. This means that VM-based installations will require port forwarding to access (see below).


System requirements
-------------------
 * Linux (tested on Ubuntu 18.04, CoreOS; not working on MacOS _yet_)
 * docker 17.04.0+, swarm mode
 * python, requests
 * make (optional)
 * [GitHub OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) credentials with callback set to `http://girder.vcap.me/api/v1/oauth/github/callback`.
 * Default user with uid:1000 and gid:100
  
 
Deployment process
------------------
The deployment process does the following:
* Pulls all required images
* Starts the WT stack via Docker swarm
* Starts the Celery worker (`gwvolman`)
    * **WARNING:** This container has fairly elavated privileges:
        *  it has access to host's filesystem
        *  it can perform multiple system calls as de facto host's root
    * **WARNING:** During `celery_worker`'s initialization host's `/usr/local` directory is overshadowed by the content of `/usr/local` from the container. 
* Runs `setup_girder.py` to initialize the instance

If you haven't already, initialize your system as a swarm master:
```
docker swarm init
```

Add default user (1000) and group (100), if not present:
```
[[ -z $(getent group 100) ]] && sudo groupadd -g 100 wtgroup
[[ -z $(getent passwd 1000) ]] && sudo useradd -g 100 -u 1000 wtuser
```

Export your Github Oauth ID and secret:
```
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<client ID>
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret>
```

Clone this repository and  run `make dev`:
```
git clone https://github.com/whole-tale/deploy-dev
cd deploy-dev/
make dev
```

To confirm things are working, all `REPLICAS` should show `1/1`
```
$ docker service ls
ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE                        PORTS
jpzhf12jh6wj        wt_dashboard        replicated          1/1                 wholetale/dashboard:latest
26gv8qfb85sq        wt_girder           replicated          1/1                 wholetale/girder:latest

p46dbxbgcae3        wt_redis            replicated          1/1                 redis:latest
vyf55zx0x95y        wt_registry         replicated          1/1                 registry:2.6                 *:443->443/tcp
41u4zyqrrv79        wt_traefik          replicated          1/1                 traefik:alpine               *:80->80/tcp, *:8080->8080/tcp
```

The `celery_worker` runs outside of swarm, confirm that it's running:
```
$ docker ps | grep celery_worker
0e8124024f03        wholetale/gwvolman:latest                                "python3 -m girder_wâ€¦"   15 hours ago        Up 15 hours                             celery_worker
```

Note: If you're running in a VM, you'll need to setup  forwarding for port 80 (requires `sudo`):
```
$ sudo ssh -L 80:localhost:80 user@VM
```


You should now be able to open a browser to http://dashboard.vcap.me to access your running instance of Whole Tale.  



Uninstall
---------

The following will remove all services and delete the volume data:

```
make clean
```
